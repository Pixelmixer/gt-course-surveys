        <p>When I created this app, I never imaged it would be this popular. I just wanted to sling some code while creating a tool that would help craft the perfect mix of classes to take every semester.</p>
        <p>Since launching in November 2015, usage has skyrocketed. We now have thousands of active users consuming gigabytes of data per month (think $1/GB).</p>
        <p>This is most obvious during registration periods when we as a community quickly surpass the concurrent user limit in Firebase's free tier (100).</p>
        <p>A huge shoutout goes to those who have already graciously donated their money to allow upgrading the app beyond the free tier, supporting unlimited concurrent sessions and hopefully making picking a course easier for the rest of us.</p>
        <p>To keep the momentum going, I need your support. I don't want to resort to ads to generate the revenue needed to support this app nor do I want folks to suffer because we can't afford to spare even a dollar for the cause.</p>
        <p>With that said, I urge you to consider making a contribution (<a href="https://paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a>). Even a dollar goes a long way.</p>
