## Stack

```
Client:   Angular, Angular Material
Server:   Node
Database: Firebase
```

## Where is the missing code?

If you examine the `.gitignore`, you will notice the following directories are omitted from the repo:

```
src/assets
src/app/triangular
```

This is intentional. These directories contain code from the [triangular template](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/), which is not open-source.
